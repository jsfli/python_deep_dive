# Python Program are just

# physical lines of code - end with a physical newline character
# logical lines of codes - end with a logical NEWLINE token

# physical newline are not necessarily the same as logical NEWLINE

## most of the time, but not always

### sometimes, physical newlines are ignored in order to combine
### multiple physical lines into a single logical line of code
### mainly for readability purposes

## these are expressed implicitly or explicitly.

## implicit expressions:
### list literals: [], tuple (), dictionary {}, sets {}

# tokenised

## for string literals, I can use triple single quotes or double quotes
''' This is a
multi-line string '''
